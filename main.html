			<h3>Imagine a path starting in Grayville and finishing in the middle of Hueston 175. The start of that path has a saturation value of 0%, it's just gray. Your final stop is fully saturated, 100%, as pure of a hue as you can do.</h3>

			<h3>Continuing your walk, you head from Darkford to Lighton. The start of your journey is pitch black, middle of the night. By the time you reach your final destination, you're engulfed in pure, bright, white light as you ascend to the heavens that are hsl(175,x,100%).</h3>
